The XOR (exclusive OR) function takes two binary inputs and outputs 1 if exactly one of the inputs is 1, and 0 otherwise. The truth table for the XOR function is:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
x_1 & x_2 & \text{XOR}(x_1, x_2) \\
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

To prove that the XOR function cannot be represented using a linear model of the form:

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b \geq 0 \\
0 & \text{if } \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b < 0
\end{cases}
$$

we can use a geometric argument by plotting the input-output pairs on a 2D plane.

### Step 1: Plotting XOR Examples on a Plane

Consider the four possible input vectors $\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2]$ and their corresponding XOR outputs. These can be plotted as points on a 2D plane where $x_1$ is on the x-axis and $x_2$ is on the y-axis:

- $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 0)$ maps to XOR = 0
- $(x_1, x_2) = (0, 1)$ maps to XOR = 1
- $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 0)$ maps to XOR = 1
- $(x_1, x_2) = (1, 1)$ maps to XOR = 0

These points can be visualized as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
(0, 1) & \rightarrow & \text{XOR} = 1 \\
\text{XOR} = 0 & & \text{XOR} = 0 \\
(0, 0) & & (1, 1) \\
\text{XOR} = 1 & & \\
(1, 0) & & \\
\end{array}
$$

On the 2D plane:

- The points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$ both have XOR = 0.
- The points $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ both have XOR = 1.

### Step 2: Analyzing Linearity

A linear model attempts to separate classes (0 and 1) using a straight line (or a linear boundary). If XOR were linearly separable, it would be possible to draw a straight line that divides the plane into two regions: one where the XOR output is 0 and another where it is 1.

However, from the plot:

- The points $(0, 0)$ and $(1, 1)$, which belong to the same class (XOR = 0), are diagonally opposite each other.
- The points $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$, which also belong to the same class (XOR = 1), are diagonally opposite each other.

This diagonal placement makes it impossible to draw a single straight line that separates the XOR = 0 points from the XOR = 1 points. Any line that attempts to separate one pair (say, separating $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ from $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$) will necessarily misclassify the other pair. Therefore, the XOR function is not linearly separable.

### Conclusion

Since a linear boundary cannot separate the input-output pairs for the XOR function, it is impossible to represent the XOR function using a linear model of the form $f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b$. This geometric reasoning shows that the XOR function cannot be implemented by a single linear threshold neuron.
